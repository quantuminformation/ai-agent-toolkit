# WARP.md

This file provides guidance to WARP (warp.dev) when working with code in this repository.

This repository is generic for open source. To avoid duplication, all operational guidance for Warp and humans is consolidated in README.md:

- Common commands: see README.md#common-commands
- Architecture overview: see README.md#high-level-architecture
- Troubleshooting: see README.md#troubleshooting

If any of those sections change, update README.md and keep this file as a pointer.
